Over the past two weeks, Suzanne and Claudia have both contributed to
our AI in the following ways.

Claudia:
- Wrote player.cpp
- Wrote the majority of the minimax algorithm
- Outlined functions to be used in board.cpp / wrote some of the 
 code for it

Suzanne:
-Researched and implemented heuristics used in AI such that it could
beat Constant Time Player
-Debugged minimax algorithm
-Debugged functions in board.cpp / made them more elegant


As far as making our AI "tournament worthy", our main effort was in
implementing the heuristics for our player and making sure our code
compiled.
